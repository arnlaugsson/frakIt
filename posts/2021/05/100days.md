I have decided to do a [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.software.com/src/essential-guide-to-the-100-days-of-code-challenge) challenge. I'm doing it for me, though, so I will make adjustments as needed for the sake of my family and my mental health. I still need to decide on challenges; I am thinking in terms of 5 and 10 days "sprints." Each sprint starts with a topic (such as a library or framework or a project) and does a little sprint planning, followed by some research and experimentation and finally working on a small prototype.

Another thing I would accomplish with this challenge and is making something someone will enjoy. Maybe a game for a family member or a usable service for something. 

I'll post an update as this progresses on, but probably not every day (maybe if there is something to share after a sprint).

Happy Coding!
