I've been busy. Busy with work, teaching, and taking care of the family. I've played some games, watched some TV with my fianc√©e, lost sleep, and slept in my kid's rooms when they were sick, worried, and relaxed. And then there were birthdays and Christmas. 

I cooked my first turkey (it was delicious) and finished my LEGO Millenium Falcon (not [this one](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/millennium-falcon-75192)), which I started a long time ago.

I wanted to do the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), but life happened. I also wanted to do a bunch of other stuff but opted to skip many of them. And I am glad.

Tonight we made leftover Turkey club sandwiches and will finish Wonderwomen '84 with my kids. I am taking the next three days off as well. 

I am fortunate to be able to do so. I am lucky to be where I am and to be able to do what I do. And this Christmas, I am choosing to be grateful for that. 

I wish you a happy new year; thanks for reading.
