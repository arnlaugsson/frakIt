A programmer in Iceland, [Sveinn Steinarsson](https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson) posted a link to a repo that he co-created containing around [12 thousand trivia questions](https://github.com/sveinn-steinarsson/is-trivia-questions).

It's divided into categories of questions, difficulty, etc.

I like the idea of doing something with this data set, so I've decided to make that my next learning project. Figuring out what to do is the first step.
